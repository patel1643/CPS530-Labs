    <p>1. The element css class used for this webpage is MainHeading I used
    it for decorating my main heading. </p>

    <p>2. The global class used for this report is Studentnumber and I used it
    to add style to the student number line on my webpage.</p>

    <p>3. The HTML only tags I used on this webpage are main and footer.</p>

    <p>4. The CSS only features I used for this webpage are gradient background
      and creative webfonts</p>

    <p>5. I password protected my page using JavaScript since I couldn't do it
    using .htaccess </p>

    <p>6. I approximately spent 4-5 hours divided in 1 week. Overall this
    lab was a good excercise for someone like me who is new to HTML.</p>
