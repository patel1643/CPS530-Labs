    <p>1. I password protected my page using JavaScript since I couldn't do it
    using .htaccess </p>
    <p>2. I tried so many new tags but one of my favourite tags would be 'style'
    tag since I can do a lot of things with the style tag like changing the
  background colour, font, font colour,etc</p>
    <p>3. I tried to load my webpage in windows explorer and I couldn't see any
      major differences except for it took 3-4 seconds more to load the webpage.</p>
    <p>4. I approximately spent 4-5 hours divided in 1 week. Overall this
    lab was a good excercise for someone like me who is new to HTML.</p>
